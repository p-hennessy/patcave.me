Using those 2 features we went from 3 hour runs down to ~25 minutes.</p><p>Competitors I've used are <a href="https://www.fabfile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabric</a> (Python lib) and <a href="https://saltproject.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaltStack</a>. I've dabbled a bit with <a href="https://www.chef.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef</a> but am very unfamiliar with it. Fabric is no longer maintained because of the Python 3 switch, but I do like the concept of managing state with the power of a programming language, but also fear that it can become very unruly very quick if you maintain poor abstractions. I like Ansible because it puts guard rails on those abstractions so things really can't get too complex or hard to understand.</p><p>For what Ansible is, it does a great job and is one of the more reliable tools I regularly use at work.</p><hr><h2>Version Control: <em><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> / <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a></em></h2><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/25231.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-xs.png 300w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-sm.png 480w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-md.png 768w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-lg.png 1024w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-xl.png 1360w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/25231-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="192" height="192"></figure><p>Github is a remote code repository and developer platform.

To be honest, until I started using VS Code, mostly I chose an editor based on if I could find a syntax color theme I liked. </p><p>I will say the #1 thing I love about VS Code is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Developer Pack</a>. Instead of running an SFTP plugin or having just a terminal in another screen, this is a truely seamless experience. You get all the same code searching and features normally only available locally with it. I've been using it to connect to remote servers as well as with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows WSL</a>. </p><p>VS Code is not as oriented to a specific task as an IDE like Eclipse or Visual Studio. This is actually nice for me since I work on a lot of different tasks and like that I can tailor VS code to my needs, instead of trying to shoe horn stuff into other IDE's.</p><hr><h2>Cloud Provider: <em>Too difficult to say</em></h2><p>Haha didn't expect that one did you?</p><p>I feel like this is very dependent on the task. Obviously I like any provider that has integration with other tools I mentioned. So ill just talk briefly about the one's I've used.</p><h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS</a></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/eeYUFCO.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-xs.png 300w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-sm.png 480w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-md.png 768w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-lg.png 1024w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-xl.png 1360w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/eeYUFCO-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="128" height="128"></figure>The biggest player in this space and by far the most features and services, most of which I don't generally use. AWS's core things work very well, but one thing I don't like about AWS is how a lot of the newer tools feel kind of thrown together and often have a lot of problems actually using them. As with their UI, the experience of the developer feels like an afterthought a lot of the time. <p></p><p>AWS is the only one I've used that has a robust virtual networking offering which is huge for any company trying to do basic network security. And on the subject of security; IAM permissions are a horrendous pain to use, especially if you're not familiar with all the in's and outs of how it works; though no other provider does it any better.</p><p>AWS is also by far the most expensive one here. For hobby projects, it's a bit costly unless you really do a good job with cost management. AWS also makes it easy to spend way more than you expect and you need dedicated engineers to pay attention to this kind of thing.</p><p>For business uses, I think AWS is the clear choice.</p><h3><a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud</a></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-xs.png 300w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-sm.png 480w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-md.png 768w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-lg.png 1024w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-xl.png 1360w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/Google-Cloud-Platform-GCP-logo-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="128" height="128"></figure>I think the biggest thing GCP has going for it is that it's UI feels "designed" and like it's not programmatically generated. <p></p><p>I had used GCP for a while with my <a href="https://patcave.me/automate-all-the-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Fortress 2 servers</a>, but ultimately ended up moving to AWS because of the lack of features for VM management and their API wasn't quite as simple to integrate with as AWS (GCP has no equivalent to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boto3</a>)</p><p>GCP's user permissions are also way more byzantine than I expected, and is somehow more confusing to me than AWS IAM. I can't believe I'm going to say this sentence: I'd rather use AWS IAM over GCP's permissions.</p><p>They offer a similar suite of features to that of AWS, and is a serious contender for business use cases.</p><p>On the subject of cost, GCP has way better cost estimation tools and they tell you the price before you stand something up in their UI; something AWS just simply does not do. Though that said, most of the time I'm standing up infrastructure programmatically so I don't really see this kind of thing often.</p><h3><a href="https://www.vultr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vultr</a></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-xs.png 300w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-sm.png 480w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-md.png 768w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-lg.png 1024w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-xl.png 1360w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/grmuy1fs409mjcg3xrqs-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="128" height="97"></figure>I like Vultr. It's simple. They have a lot of good locations in the US, which is great for me as someone who hosts game servers. <p></p><p>They obviously don't have nearly as many features as AWS or GCP, but they knock their VM stuff out of the park. Infact you can literally upload your own .iso to it and just run that; opening up the possibility of doing local builds and just sharing an .iso. They also have Windows VM's if you need that kind of thing.</p><p>They have recently added an S3-compatible "spaces" offering which I'm using to good effect for TF2maps static sites. It's not fully flushed out though, so I'll hold my judgement on it for now.</p><p>It has everything you need for small projects. Built-in DNS, VM's, Block Storage, Firewalls, Load Balancers. It's networking is lacking a bit in my opinion. </p><p>3 features I want from Vultr:</p><ul><li>An AWS Fargate type docker runtime. Basically I just give you a container and you run it</li><li>Lambda's</li><li>Managed databases</li></ul><p>A few years ago I had a lot of networking issues hosting game servers, which has turned me off from using them. It appears that this is no longer a problem given we're running almost entirely on Vultr at TF2Maps.</p><h3><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-xs.png 300w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-sm.png 480w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-md.png 768w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-lg.png 1024w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-xl.png 1360w, https://patcave.me/media/posts/10/responsive/1200px-DigitalOcean_logo.svg-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="128" height="128"></figure>Very similar to Vultr, and similarly I do like DigitalOcean for the same reasons. Their networking is more mature and they do have a database offering as well. They recently launched an Apps feature, which as far as I can tell is basically just <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a>.<p></p><p> </p><p>If DigitalOcean added the features i mentioned in the Vultr section, I'd happily switch to them. They have the managed DB part down.</p><hr><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.packer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Packer </a>- A simple program for doing Golden image builds. Very modular and simple</li><li><a href="https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/rkt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RKT</a> - A Docker-compatible runtime that has a lot more security features vs Docker itself. </li><li><a href="https://www.pgcli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgcli</a>, <a href="https://www.mycli.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mycli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/litecli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litecli</a> - Database CLI's that use <a href="https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt-Toolkit</a>. Nice features like syntax highlighting, and context aware tab completion</li><li><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tmux</a> - Great for running some services in the background without losing access to the command line.

I'm not married to any one of these tools and will switch if another tool comes along that solves my problem better. </p><p>To me it's more important to follow principals of staying organized than to become obsessed with how a certain tool solves a problem. Almost all of these tools I like because they allow me to maintain that kind of simplicity and organization that I want.</p><p>One final thought; remember that everyone's use case is different and sometimes a tool is still a better choice even when it has less exciting features because of things like cost and whether engineers at your organization are already familiar with it. There is a cost to onboarding new tools and learning their paradigms.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://patcave.me/tags/computer-science/">Programming Stuff</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://patcave.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://patcave.me/i-am-officially-a-professional-game-designer/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> I&#x27;m officially a &quot;professional&quot; game designer!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://patcave.me/disaster-averted/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Disaster Averted </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://patcave.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© Patrick Hennessy 2014 - 2022</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
