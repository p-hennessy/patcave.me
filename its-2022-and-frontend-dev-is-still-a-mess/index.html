Recently, I've wanted to work on some projects requiring me to write a web front-end and every time I revisit doing this, I'm left feeling very frustrated and defeated.</p><h2 id="i-actually-like-frontend">I actually like front-end</h2><p>I've always like the creative aspect of web design and working on visual mediums. At one point I thought I'd be doing front end dev, but quickly decided to not pursue it after working on front-end stuff at Carfax for about a year.&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, front-end was mostly dominated by jQuery plugins and crazy over-engineered MVC frameworks. Around this time, Bootstrap was released, along with a bunch of other CSS / JS frameworks that were <em>supposed&nbsp;</em>to help make development faster. They kind of did, but also introduced a lot of issues with customizing things to your needs that you were probably better off writing your own library for you own needs.&nbsp;</p><p>As a programmer, I thoroughly enjoy the fact that other people write high quality libraries so that I can just reuse their code and not have to think about those problems and just get going with my project. This is true for most things I do with DevOps and backend libraries in Python. And those libraries / tools work great most of the time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="brhow-it-feels-to-be-a-frontend-dev-in-2022"><br>How it FEELS to be a front-end dev in 2022</h2><p>You have a new project and your colleague told you that React is good and an industry standard. So you spend the next hour just trying to choose one out of literally thousands of component libraries to use.&nbsp;</p><p>After you spend an hour waiting for NPM to finish installing the 50mb of needed NodeJS packages, and you finished reading for another hour on Webpack docs so that you can have a constantly running build pipeline locally because this framework uses MochaScript; a way better version of JavaScript apparently that has to be compiled. Now you can finally start a local webserver with the convenient and never broken npm start dev command!</p><p>If by some miracle you get that working in less than a half day, now you get finally use these components! Wait, the docs don't have copy and passable code? Well that sucks, but good thing the frontend community adheres to common conventions. After all; what really is the semantic difference between a Modal, Dialog, Popup, Popover.</p><p>So after a while of thoroughly reading all the docs, you finally figured out what to do. You start writing your app, and get pretty far.</p><p>But wait! A&nbsp;new thing came out this week!<br></p><p>The library you are now relying on for your front-end has decided to categorically switch tools, now you have to decide if you will update to this standard. . You thought you were good using JavaScript; but now you gotta learn CoffeeScript! Its like JavaScript, but slower and with questionable syntactic sugar<br></p><pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code>exampleCode().
  showing(aThing(), thisLibrary.does())
  .justIgnore(
    () -&gt; theSyntax()
);
</code></pre><p>So readable.</p><p>These kinds of chained call backs never have unexpected behavior and defaintly dont ever have issues compiling back to ES6. But don't sweat it too much, wait another few months and they'll be using MelonScript or SuperScript, or some new flavor that is supposed to solve all it's problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Since you decided not to upgrade, now you wont receive any bug fixes or new features. Bummer I guess. But your app has been in production for a few months and now you do need to fix some of those bugs because they are affecting you. Well now you can't even upgrade anyway; because the package maintainer <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/open-source-npm-packages-colors-faker/" target="_blank">took the library off the internet and replaced it with bitcoin mining software to protest Climate Change</a>.</p><p>Now I admit that these issues are not exclusive to JavaScript / Frontend dev.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it feels especially bad in frontend because of how quickly things are changing. And to what end? Sometimes I really wonder; have we not found the right abstractions to write engaging and pretty user interfaces? Why is it this difficult just to get a basic dynamic page working?<br><br></p><p>I loved the simplicity of the old web. You can super quickly prototype something on a local web page. You didn't need to worry about package managers, CDN's, or running a web server.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been following the evolution of front-end stuff for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't think front-end devs realize how complex they have made their ecosystem. And I would submit, needlessly so.&nbsp;</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://patcave.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://patcave.me/disaster-averted/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Disaster Averted</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Â© Patrick Hennessy 2014 - 2022</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
